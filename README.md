# API Documentation

## Backend Deployed On Heroku [https://clone-coding-server.herokuapp.com/](https://clone-coding-server.herokuapp.com/) <br>

##  Getting Started

### Scripts

- **yarn install** to install all required dependencies
- **yarn dev** to start the local server
- **yarn test** to start server using testing environment  
- **yarn db_start_dev** to start docker development Postgres database
- **yarn db_start_test** to start docker testing database
- **yarn db_reset_dev** to migrate and rollback seeds in developer database
- **yarn db_reset_test** to migrate and rollback seeds in developer tests
- **yarn db_stop_dev** burns down development database
- **yarn db_stop_test** burn down testing database
